<p>Tiny5 is a 5-pixel variable font inspired by the graphing calculators and digital gadgets of the 1980s-90s, where the constraints of limited pixel space demanded efficient and minimalist design.</p>

<p>It features three variable axes: pixel volume, roundness and bleed. These allow to mimic the visual characteristics of LCD screens, CRT monitors and dot matrix printouts.</p>

<p>Tiny5 is perfect for evoking a retro or nostalgic feel, for conveying the idea of minimalism, or for efficiently presenting information on small displays.</p>

<p>It supports the Google Fonts Latin Kernel, Latin Core, Latin Plus, Latin Beyond, Latin African, Latin PriAfrican, Latin Vietnamese, Greek Core, Greek Plus, Greek Pro, Cyrillic Core and Cyrillic Plus character set.</p>
